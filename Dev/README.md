# Materialism Dev Theme

A specialized, text-first version of Materialism designed for developers and tech journals.

## ⚡ Design Philosophy
- **Minimalist**: Strip away distractions. No hero images, no bulky cards.
- **Text-Centric**: Primary focus on content legibility and typography.
- **Monospace Aesthetics**: Uses `JetBrains Mono` for headers, meta info, and navigation to evoke a code editor feel.
- **Performance**: Extremely lightweight with minimal image loading constraints.

## 🛠 Features
- **Git-Log Style Layout**: Posts are displayed as a clean, chronological list.
- **Code-Friendly Typography**: Optimized for reading technical content.
- **Single Column**: Narrower reading width (800px) for better focus.
- **Threaded Comments**: Retained full functionality but styled to look cleaner.

## 📦 Installation
Upload `dev.xml` to your Blogger theme settings.
